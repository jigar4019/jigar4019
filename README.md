| An analysis of competing website |
| ------- |
| We have competed our website with some other providers/websites. We found that some of the ways are different in our website then others. For example: |
| •	our website is ordering the food to suppliers directly and automatically count the stock in the restaurant which is new on the website of restaurants I have not seen on any other restaurant website. | 
| •	On our online orders from website sets earning points for the customers which can attract customers. That I have not seen on any other websites for example Zomato. |
